# ~~~~~
# The secret key is used to secure cryptographics functions
# If you deploy your application to several instances be sure to use the same key !

# date.format.fr=dd/MM/yyyy

# Server configuration
# ~~~~~
# If you need to change the HTTP port, uncomment this (default is set to 9000)
http.port=9001
#
# By default the server listen for HTTP on the wilcard address.
# You can restrict this.
# http.address=127.0.0.1
#
# Use this if you don't host your Play application at the root of the domain
# you're serving it from. This parameter has no effect when deployed as a
# war, because the path will be handled by the application server.
# http.path=/

# Session configuration
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# By default, session will be written to the transient PLAY_SESSION cookie.
# The cookies are not secured by default, only set it to true
# if you're serving your pages through https.
# application.session.cookie=PLAY
# application.session.maxAge=1h
# application.session.secure=false

# Session/Cookie sharing between subdomain
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# By default a cookie is only valid for a specific domain. By setting
# application.defaultCookieDomain to '.example.com', the cookies
# will be valid for all domains ending with '.example.com', ie:
# foo.example.com and bar.example.com
# application.defaultCookieDomain=.example.com

# JVM configuration
# ~~~~~
# Define which port is used by JPDA when application is in debug mode (default is set to 8000)
# jpda.port=8000
#
# Java source level => 1.5, 1.6 or 1.7 (experimental)
# java.source=1.5

# Log level
# ~~~~~
# Specify log level for your application.
# If you want a very customized log, create a log4j.properties file in the conf directory
# application.log=INFO
#
# More logging configuration
# application.log.path=/log4j.properties
# application.log.system.out=off

# Database configuration
# ~~~~~
# Enable a database engine if needed.
#
# To quickly set up a development database, use either:
#   - mem : for a transient in memory database (H2 in memory)
#   - fs  : for a simple file written database (H2 file stored)
db=mem
#
# To connect to a local MySQL5 database, use:
# db=mysql://user:pwd@host/database
#
# To connect to a local PostgreSQL9 database, use:
# db=postgres://user:pwd@host/database
#
# If you need a full JDBC configuration use the following :
# db.url=jdbc:postgresql:database_name
# db.driver=org.postgresql.Driver
# db.user=root
# db.pass=secret
#
# Connections pool configuration :
# db.pool.timeout=1000
# db.pool.maxSize=30
# db.pool.minSize=10
#
# If you want to reuse an existing Datasource from your application server, use:
# db=java:/comp/env/jdbc/myDatasource
#
# When using an existing Datasource, it's sometimes needed to destroy it when
# the application is stopped. Depending on the datasource, you can define a
# generic "destroy" method :
# db.destroyMethod=close

# JPA Configuration (Hibernate)
# ~~~~~
#
# Specify the custom JPA dialect to use here (default to guess):
# jpa.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
#
# Specify the ddl generation pattern to use. Set to none to disable it
# (default to update in DEV mode, and none in PROD mode):
jpa.ddl=create-drop
#
# Debug SQL statements (logged using DEBUG level):
# jpa.debugSQL=true
#
# You can even specify additional hibernate properties here:
# hibernate.use_sql_comments=true
# ...
#
# Store path for Blob content
attachments.path=data/attachments

# Memcached configuration
# ~~~~~
# Enable memcached if needed. Otherwise a local cache is used.
# memcached=enabled
#
# Specify memcached host (default to 127.0.0.1:11211)
# memcached.host=127.0.0.1:11211
#
# Or you can specify multiple host to build a distributed cache
# memcached.1.host=127.0.0.1:11211
# memcached.2.host=127.0.0.1:11212
#
# Use plain SASL to authenticate for memcached
# memcached.user=
# memcached.password=

# HTTP Response headers control for static files
# ~~~~~
# Set the default max-age, telling the user's browser how long it should cache the page.
# Default is 3600 (one hour). Set it to 0 to send no-cache.
# This is only read in prod mode, in dev mode the cache is disabled.
# http.cacheControl=3600

# If enabled, Play will generate entity tags automatically and send a 304 when needed.
# Default is true, set it to false to deactivate use of entity tags.
# http.useETag=true

# Custom mime types
# mimetype.xpi=application/x-xpinstall

# WS configuration
# ~~~~~
# Default engine is Async Http Client, uncomment to use
# the JDK's internal implementation
# webservice = urlfetch
# If you need to set proxy params for WS requests
# http.proxyHost = localhost
# http.proxyPort = 3128
# http.proxyUser = jojo
# http.proxyPassword = jojo

# Mail configuration
# ~~~~~
# Default is to use a mock Mailer
mail.smtp=mock

# Or, specify mail host configuration
# mail.smtp.host=127.0.0.1
# mail.smtp.user=admin
# mail.smtp.pass=
# mail.smtp.channel=ssl

# Url-resolving in Jobs
# ~~~~~~
# When rendering templates with reverse-url-resoling (@@{..}) in Jobs (which do not have an inbound Http.Request),
# ie if sending a HtmlMail, Play need to know which url your users use when accessing your app.
# %test.application.baseUrl=http://localhost:9000/
# %prod.application.baseUrl=http://www.yourdomain.com/

# Jobs executor
# ~~~~~~
# Size of the Jobs pool
# play.jobs.pool=10

# Execution pool
# ~~~~~
# Default to 1 thread in DEV mode or (nb processors + 1) threads in PROD mode.
# Try to keep a low as possible. 1 thread will serialize all requests (very useful for debugging purpose)
# play.pool=3

# Open file from errors pages
# ~~~~~
# If your text editor supports opening files by URL, Play! will
# dynamically link error pages to files
#
# Example, for textmate:
# play.editor=txmt://open?url=file://%s&line=%s

# Testing. Set up a custom configuration for test mode
# ~~~~~
#%test.module.cobertura=${play.path}/modules/cobertura

#Greenscript configuration
# Default greenscript.dir.js point to /public/javascripts
greenscript.dir.js=/public
#
# Default dir.css point to /public/stylesheets
greenscript.dir.css=/public
#
# Default minimized file folder point to /public/gs
greenscript.dir.minimized=/public/gs

#URL path - GreenScript uses to output javascript, css or compressed files, start from root url.
greenscript.url.js=/public
greenscript.url.css=/public

# Enable/Disable minimize
# 	Once minimize disabled, GreenScript will output the original javascript/css
# 	files without any processing. However, the order of the files is guaranteed
#	to follow the dependency graph you have defined in "greenscript.conf" file
#
#	When minimize turned on, GreenScript will merge all javascript/css files
#	within one HTTP request into a single file. Again the merge order is
#	guaranteed to follow the dependency graph you have defined in the
#	"greenscript.conf" file
#
#	Note if you turn off minimize, the rest 2 settings (compress, cache) will
#	not function whatever the value they are
#
# By Default minimize is turned on in prod mode and turned off in dev mode
greenscript.minimize=false
#
# Enable/Disable compress
#	Once compress is enabled, GreenScript will compress the javascript/css files
#	while doing the merge operation.
#
# By default compress is turned on in prod mode and turned off in dev mode
greenscript.compress=false
#
# Enable/Disable cache
#	Once cache is turned on, GreenScript will try best to reuse the processed
#	file instead of repeat the merge/compress process.
#
# By default cache is turned on in prod mode and turned off in dev mode
greenscript.cache=true

# Enable/Disable in-memory cache
#   Once in-memory cache is turned on, GreenScript will use a memory buffer to
#   store the minimized resource instead of a temporary file. This feature could
#   be useful to those apps hosted on clouds without normal File IO, e.g. GAE
# This item is by default false
greenscript.cache.inmemory=true
#
# Enable/Disable LESS support
#   Once LESS support enabled, GreenScript will try to compile css file
#   using LESS CSS engine before processing it. By default this option
#   is turned off
greenscript.less.enabled=true
#
# Enable/Disable inline script processing
#   Once this configuration is turned on, GreenScript will try to process inline code
#   before output them. Here "process" means use less engine to compile the css code and
#   use compressor to compress both css and js code. By default the configuration is
#   turned off
greenscript.inline.process=false
#
# Set css file last-modified timestamp check frequence. default to 10 seconds
# greenscript.css.cache.check=10s
#
# Set js file last-modified timestamp check frequence. default to 10 seconds
# greenscript.js.cache.check=10s
